This project simulates the dice game "Going to Boston" using simple JavaScript and HTML.  

**GAMEPLAY:**  
There are two players and an odd number of rounds.
  
Before the rounds start, each player throws their die, and the player with the highest number will play first in each round.
  
In each round, each player throws three dice, then two dice, and then one die. The die with the highest number from each throw is added to the player's score for that round.  
  
The player with the highest score wins the round, and then the scores are reset for the following round. If there is a tie between the two players' scores for a round, no one wins the round.  
  
The player with the highest number of rounds won wins the game. If each player won an equal number of rounds, it is a tie.
